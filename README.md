# Wasm Runtime

An interim runtime for running WASI WebAssembly components.

This wasm runtime is a stop-gap solution until production-grade runtimes such as [`wasmtime`](https://github.com/bytecodealliance/wasmtime)
can support components based on the [`wasi-cloud-core`](https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasi-cloud-core) specifications.

## Quick Start

Install `cargo-component`:

```bash
cargo install cargo-component
```
